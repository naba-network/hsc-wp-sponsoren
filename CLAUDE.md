# HSC Sponsoren – project rules

WordPress plugin for the HSC Hohenems club website. Manages the club's partners/sponsors as a single source of truth and provides lists and sliders that can be embedded in the website.

Sponsor groups: Hauptsponsor (exactly 1), Premium (n), Sponsoren (n), Gönner (n). German only, informal "du".

If you add or update ANY file in this directory, you MUST use these skills if a matching file is touched:

- `vue-best-practices`
- `frontend-best-practices`
- `php-best-practices`
- `php-engineer`
- `php-testing`

Alwayse use these skills for all tasks:

- `caveman`


## This repository is PUBLIC

Everything committed or pushed is world-readable and stays in git history. **Never commit or push anything private or sensitive**, including:

- API keys, tokens, passwords, OAuth client secrets, service-account JSON files, private keys
- `.env` files, `wp-config.php` snippets with credentials, local config overrides
- Real sponsor data that is not meant to be public (contract details, amounts, private contact persons, emails, phone numbers), personal data of members or staff. Use fake sponsors in tests, docs and examples.
- Internal URLs, server paths, hostnames or infrastructure details

Rules:

- Keep secrets out of the code: read them from WordPress options, `wp-config.php` constants or environment variables, never hardcode them.
- Use obviously fake values in tests, docs and examples (e.g. `example@example.com`, `Muster Sponsor GmbH`).
- Before every commit, check `git status` / `git diff --staged` for anything that looks like a secret or personal data. If unsure, ask instead of committing.
- Add new secret-bearing file patterns to `.gitignore` (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*credentials*.json`, `*service-account*.json`, `wp-config.php`).
- If a secret was pushed by accident: tell the user immediately. Rewriting history is not enough – the secret must be revoked/rotated.
- Do not commit or push without the user asking for it.

## Conventions

The project is just starting (empty repo). The tooling below mirrors `hsc-wp-plugin-google-calendar` and should be set up the same way; until then, treat it as the target.

- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` …); the release workflow derives version bumps and changelog from them.
- `main`: CI (lint + tests). Push to `production`: release workflow bumps version, readme, changelog, tags and publishes the zip. Do not edit version numbers by hand.
- Checks: `composer lint`, `composer test`. Plugin code supports PHP 8.0+ (CI matrix 8.1/8.3) and follows WordPress Coding Standards.
